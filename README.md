C++ STL is generic collection of class templates & algorithms.
It allows to easily implement Standard DS like Stacks, queues & lists.

STL has 
- Containers,
- iterators
- algorithms

C++ STL has following Constructs/Containers grouped into 3 categories:
ⅰ) Sequences: Vectors, lists etc (array, dequeue, forward_list)
ⅱ) container adaptors : Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues etc
iii) Associative containers: Bitsets, Maps, Multimaps, Sets, Multisets, etc (unordered set, unordered multiset, unordered map, unordered multimap)

1. Vector
2. List
3. Priority Queue
   
   - Operator Overloading 
   - for_each and range based for loop 
   - some_generic_algo 
   
4. Stack
5. Queue
